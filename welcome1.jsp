Someone has said life is full of surprises,struggle,excitement,happieness,
friends,emotions etc.Yes, it is indeed true.I have experienced many 
more in my short span of life till now(many more yet to come).I was born
 in Bhagwanpur,Bihar.After spending initial childhood days in my village,
i started moving to different places like meerut(Uttar Pradesh),Hisar(Haryana),
Pathankot(Punjab) and many more.Till now, i have visited and stayed at places 
bangalore,mumbai,hyderabad,chennai,delhi.So,in short i have explored almost all 
parts of india expect eastern india.Exploring eastern india is on my wishlist.I 
completed my schooling from 5 differnet states and hence in the process found many 
friends and interacted with many people.It also gave me chance of seeing different 
lifestyles & languages of people.Sometime, i feel very blessed to have al this.
